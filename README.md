## Selenium Cucumber Demo

This demo shows how to use Java 8, JUnit, Cucumber, and Selenium WebDriver
to run end-to-end tests against a running application instance
(i.e. a deployed website). It contains a basic test for the Zirous website
search functionality. The test simulates a user clicking on the magnifying
glass in the website header and searching for a given topic.

Please check out the
"[End-to-End Testing with Cucumber and Selenium WebDriver](https://www.zirous.com/blog/)"
article on the [Zirous Blog](https://www.zirous.com/blog/)
